# Proyecto Teamsight, Attrition Prediction

**TO START CODING**

Firsts things to do:

1. Clone the repository
https://github.com/Bimex-es/Attrition.git

2. Then create your own notebook.  

3. Upload your notebook and sync it frequently from your local folder (from your terminal):
  git stash #leave your changes aside
  
  git pull #pull current version in website
  
  git stash pop #combine your changes
  
  git add .
  
  git commit -m "Comment here your updates"
  
  git push
  
4. Before coming back to work locally: 
  git pull

Files Description

  - ### Coding 
    - **Machine_Learning_Python_TFM.ipynb:** Here we study the Machine Learning part of the project. We strive to do a Machine Learning device to predict the attrition probability of a subject or a group.
    - **Probability_and_main_Python_TFM.ipynb:** Here we study the Probability part of the project. We strive to implement probability knowledge to relate it to attrition rates.
    - **TFM_first_dataframe_found.ipynb:** This code consists on the replication and improvement on a code found in Kaggle with the link [https://www.kaggle.com/code/vincentlugat/ibm-attrition-analysis-and-prediction#3.-Feature-engineering-and-selection].
    - **TFM_segundo_DataFrame_GitHub(NO_USE).ipynb:** This code consists on the replication and improvement of a code relatied to attrition rates found in a public GitHub repository named *employee-attrition-aif360*.
    - **WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv:** DataFrame implemented in all the codes above. It consists on a category based description of 1470 people regarding personal and labour related aspects with the characteristic of having an Attrition column.

## Objectives of the study

The main objetive of this study is to create a MachineLearning/Probability based computing system to calculate the probability fo attrition of certain people or groups in a given company. Furthermore, after this first step being completed, we strive to understand why the main reasons this person/group wanted to leave in the first place.
