Firsts things to do:

1. Clone the repository
https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository

3. Upload your notebook and sync it frequently from your local folder (from your terminal):
  git stash #leave your changes aside

  git stash pop #combine your changes
  
  git add .
  
  git commit -m "Comment here your updates"
